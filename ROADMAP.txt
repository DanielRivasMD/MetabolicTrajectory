- initial statistical analysis
- calculate dynamic time warping => section records into parts & capture local profile
- implement graph analysis => fully connected graph -> pruned graph
- multivariate time series analysis => multivariate ARIMA, VAR, stateâ€‘space models, RNNs
- time series encoding => linear |> PCA; non-linear |> AE
- encode into high-dimensional time series => feature engineering; visualization => t-SNE & UMAP
- spectral frecuency domian => FFT
- autocorrelation
- simulate waves for dtw
