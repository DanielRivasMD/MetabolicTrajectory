- initial statistical analysis
- calculate dynamic time warping => section records into parts & capture local profile
- implement graph analysis => fully connected graph -> pruned graph
- multivariate time series analysis => multivariate ARIMA, VAR, stateâ€‘space models, RNNs
- time series encoding => linear |> PCA; non-linear |> AE
- encode into high-dimensional time series => feature engineering; visualization => t-SNE & UMAP
- spectral frecuency domian => FFT
- autocorrelation

- justify the subsample experiment
- compare the subsample experiment to simulated basic stat analysis
- potential bug: subsampling percentualy might introduce bias on the costs, therefore select the longest signal in the group & fix the subsample length in relation to that one

- reconsider using notebooks heavily
- perform clustering on dtw matrices
