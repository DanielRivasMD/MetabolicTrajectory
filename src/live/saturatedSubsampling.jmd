# Description
Extract signal patterns from metabolic trajectories by Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)

```julia; echo = false, results = "hidden"
include("saturatedSubsampling/config.jl")
include("saturatedSubsampling/util.jl")
```


1 index = 4.5 minutes
whole recording 2200 indexes
165 hours = 6.9 days
5% ≈ 110 indices = 8 h 15 min


```julia; echo = false
# include("saturatedSubsampling/ck1.jl")
include("saturatedSubsampling/ck2.jl")
```
