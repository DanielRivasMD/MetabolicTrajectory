# Description
Extract signal patterns from metabolic trajectories by Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)

```julia; echo = false, results = "hidden"
include("saturatedSubsampling/config.jl")
include("saturatedSubsampling/util.jl")
```


1 index = 4.5 minutes
whole recording 2200 indexes
165 hours = 6.9 days
5% ≈ 110 indices = 8 h 15 min


DTW analysis and clustering loop
For each variable of interest, we:
1. Subsample each animal’s signal into many short segments (to capture variability).
2. Compute a pairwise DTW cost matrix between all subsamples, normalized by length.
3. Perform hierarchical clustering on the DTW distances.
4. Visualize the clustered cost matrix as a heatmap to reveal structure in the signals.



```julia; echo = false
include("saturatedSubsampling/ck1.jl")
```
