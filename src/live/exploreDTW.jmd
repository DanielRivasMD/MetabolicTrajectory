# Description
Simulate signales & compare them using Euclidean distance & Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)

In this section we generate clean sine and cosine signals and compare them.
We compute the DTW cost matrix, visualize it as a heatmap, and overlay the
optimal alignment path on the original signals. This illustrates how DTW
compensates for phase differences between two smooth periodic signals.

```julia; echo = false
include("exploreDTW/ck1.jl")
```

Here we generate two purely random sequences to show a contrasting case.
With no underlying structure, both Euclidean distance and DTW cost are large
and the alignment path is essentially meaningless. This demonstrates that DTW
is only informative when signals share some temporal pattern.

```julia; echo = false
include("exploreDTW/ck2.jl")
```

In this section we add low‑level Gaussian noise to sine and cosine signals.
Despite the noise, DTW is able to recover a meaningful alignment path and
produce a reasonable similarity measure, showing its robustness to noise.

```julia; echo = false
include("exploreDTW/ck3.jl")
```

Here we explore the Sakoe–Chiba radius parameter, which restricts how far
the warping path can deviate from the diagonal of the cost matrix.
We compute DTW costs for several radii, visualize the cost vs radius curve,
and show how too‑small radii are overly restrictive while larger radii allow
more flexible alignments.

```julia; echo = false
include("exploreDTW/ck4.jl")
include("exploreDTW/ck5.jl")
```

Finally, we compare sine and cosine signals of different lengths.
We show how raw DTW cost increases with sequence length mismatch,
and how normalizing by average sequence length alleviates this bias.
Heatmaps for the shortest and longest cases illustrate how DTW handles
unequal lengths in practice.

```julia; echo = false
include("exploreDTW/ck6.jl")
```
